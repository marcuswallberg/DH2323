# DH2323
Course project in DH2323 by Marcus Wallberg & Johanna Gustafsson
## Setup
To run the project files you need to: 
* Set up a working version of SDL version 1
  * Xcode or Visual studio 2015 recommended
* Add the following to your root project directory:
  * GLM library 
  * SDLauxiliary.h
  * main.cpp

The setup is part of the setup to the course DH2323 at KTH the spring of 2017. If you are part of that course or have access to the lab instructions, you only need to add main.cpp to your project and run it!
